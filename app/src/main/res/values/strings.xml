        Scatterbrain is a platform for building rich media apps that don\'t need a data plan to work.
        Using bluetooth, wifi, and your own physical social network. Scatterbrain forwards content to all
        your friends even if they are miles away. Scatterbrain powers an entire ecosystem of 3rd party apps on
        your phone, on your desktop, and beyond! Anyone can make an app leveraging the Scatterbrain Router to
        enable offline communication with any device on the Scatterbrain network.
        So, how is this possible if bluetooth and wifi only work over short ranges? Scatterbrain
        swaps messages with other Scatterbrain enabled phones that you pass on the street and allows them to
        carry your messages to their destination as they go about their own day. Messages spread
        like rumors throughout your neighborhood, powered by human connections!


        To get started using Scatterbrain, first you need to grant a few permissions. These are required for the
        Scatterbrain Router app to access your phone\'s bluetooth/wifi hardware. Press "Next" to begin the setup process"

    <string name="battery_description">
        To prevent android from pausing Scatterbrain in the background, it is possible to grant an exemption from automatic battery optimization for Scatterbrain router.
        This should prevent android from killing the Scatterbrain service in the background which should improve performance.
        This is optional, as Scatterbrain will try its best to operate without being killed even without this permission.
        Because most background tasks are run on the bluetooth adapter itself you should not see any noticeable drain on battery
        even if you grant this permission.
