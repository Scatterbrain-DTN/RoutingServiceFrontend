        The NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES permission is required to perform
        wifi direct operations in the background on newer devices
        this is used in tandem with bluetooth to speed to transfers to nearby
        devices that are capable of wifi direct
    </string>
    <string name="advertise_description">
        The BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE permission is used to broadcast an anonymous id that nearby devices can connect to.
        The id is randomized frequently to prevent tracking.

    <string name="bluetooth_connect_description">
        The BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission is used to connect to Scatterbrain peers in the background using BLE

    <string name="bluetooth_scan_description">
        The BLUETOOTH_SCAN permission is required on newer devices to discover Scatterbrain peers in the background via bluetooth
    </string>
    <string name="location_description">
        The ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission is required in order to 
        enable background bluetooth connections while the app is closed. This collects location data for the sole purpose
        of bluetooth network. This data is not shared and does not leave your device.
        Android requires this permission to access wifi and bluetooth. This is a requirement set
        by google to preserve privacy when collecting location data from external device IDs

        This location permission does not actually use the GPS location, it only allows Scatterbrain to
        access the bluetooth adapter. The reason your device requires ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION for bluetooth
        is because some apps use 3rd party bluetooth devices to find your devices approximate location by
        looking up their device ids. Scatterbrain does not do this.

        Scatterbrain is a platform for building rich media apps that don\'t need a data plan to work.
        Using bluetooth, wifi, and your own physical social network. Scatterbrain forwards content to all
        your friends even if they are miles away. Scatterbrain powers an entire ecosystem of 3rd party apps on
        your phone, on your desktop, and beyond! Anyone can make an app leveraging the Scatterbrain Router to
        enable offline communication with any device on the Scatterbrain network.
        So, how is this possible if bluetooth and wifi only work over short ranges? Scatterbrain
        swaps messages with other Scatterbrain enabled phones that you pass on the street and allows them to
        carry your messages to their destination as they go about their own day. Messages spread
        like rumors throughout your neighborhood, powered by human connections!


        To get started using Scatterbrain, first you need to grant a few permissions. These are required for the
        Scatterbrain Router app to access your phone\'s bluetooth/wifi hardware. Press "Next" to begin the setup process"

    <string name="battery_description">
        To prevent android from pausing Scatterbrain in the background, it is possible to grant an exemption from automatic battery optimization for Scatterbrain router.
        This should prevent android from killing the Scatterbrain service in the background which should improve performance.
        This is optional, as Scatterbrain will try its best to operate without being killed even without this permission.
        Because most background tasks are run on the bluetooth adapter itself you should not see any noticeable drain on battery
        even if you grant this permission.
